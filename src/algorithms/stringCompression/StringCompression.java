package algorithms.stringCompression;


/* level: Easy
	Give an array of characters, compress it in-place
The length after compression must always be smaller 
than or equal to the original array. Every element of the
array should be a character(not int) of lenght 1.
After you are done modifying the input array in-place,
return the new length of the array.
example input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
         output: 6  "aa" is replaced by "a2"
					  "bb"	is replaced by "b2"
					  "ccc"	is replaced by "c3" */

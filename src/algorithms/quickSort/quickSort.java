/*
An Array {15,3,2,1,9,5,7,8,6}, it first divides the input array 
into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements.
1.Pick an element,called a pivot, from the array.
2.Partioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than
the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot
come after it(equal values can go either way).After this partioning, the pivot is in its final position.
3.Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to
the sub-array of elements with greater values.*/

 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy"
 * 
 * Happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting
 * with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares
 * of its digits, and repeate the process until the number equals 1(where it will stay),
 * or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.Those numbers for which 
 * this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

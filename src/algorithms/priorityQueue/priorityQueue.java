/* A heap is a specific tree based data structure in which all the nodes of
 * tree are in a specific order.Let's say if X is a parent node of Y, then 
 * the value of X follows some specific order with respect to value of Y and 
 * the same order will be followed across the tree.
 * 
 * The maximum number of children of a node in the heap depends on the type of heap.
 * However in the more commonly used heap type, there are at most 2 children of a note 
 * and it's known as a Binary heap.
